#_Additional Statement_
#May not (or may) be expected to implement any cryptography (eg. ciphers, ECB/CBC/XTS modes), may only call, in the same manner as would a user by dragging-and-dropping text edited files onto, or by 'double-clicking', an icon, in a graphical user interface, entirely separate programs (eg. TrueCrypt/VeraCrypt, GPG, OpenSSL binaries). Functionality is reasonably expected reasonably possible for a human to perform without compiling software, by completing steps described by an entirely human readable document of less complexity than a usual novel. Padding of random, date, incremental, or length, may or may not be among these steps. Whether such could reasonably be considered itself non-standard encryption software may not be obvious, such notice(s) as given here may or may not in fact be required, offered only to better guarantee compliance with any possible necessity, and not to suggest any expectation as to whether such notice was actually necessary.
