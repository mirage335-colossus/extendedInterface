*) Gamma. Typically 2.0 . Shaders mod may or may not require +0.2 adjustment .
*) Water. 'Low' for Nevada. 'Medium' or greater, if shaders mod enabled.
*) Grass/Trees. Reduce during simulated aircraft startup procedure if needed.
*) MSAA. Keep at 2x if possible, turn off if necessary.

_Shader Mod_
*) Set "MASKSIZE" under "_HMD.hlsl" to 0.7 for Pimax 5kp at 'Normal' FOV.
*) Maybe disable 'SIMPLE_GRASS' under "_HMD.hlsl". May be unaesthetic.
*) Some shader mod files may need to be disabled for compatibility with new DCS World versions.

*) Fixed Foveated Rendering apparently compiles some shaders in addition to those compiled without.

*) Water must be 'Medium' or greater. Removing the file for water from the mod did not resolve this.

_ Google Earth GPS - DCS_NMEA.lua , com0com _

Google Earth must not be blocking serial ports.
Beware 'Quit to Desktop' or full OS reboot may be required between flights.
Destination port (COM2) will be read by application, source port (COM1) will be written by sim.

sPort_Nr = 1

_SRS_
In client.cfg:
	DisableWindowVisibilityCheck=true

As necessary, under 'Settings', use 'Reset Radio Overlay' button.




_Quality_
-High Quality Tradeoffs-
A few features crucially impact readability, and should not be reduced unless necessary.
*) Textures.		Anything less than 'High'...
	*) May greatly reduce at least F5E instrument resolution.
	*) Greatly reduces FA18C AMPCD (moving map), kneeboard resolution. May reduce FA18C DDI resolution.
*) Terrain Textures	Only 'High'/'Low'.
	*) Little if any visual quality improvement with 'High'.

A few features should not be enabled.
*) Shadows, Terrain Object Shadows. Extreme CPU frametime cost.
*) SSAA.

Some settings may be traded quickly to maintain framerates without serious loss of visual quality.
*) Water.
	*) 'High', 'Medium'. Add detailed surface wave, reflection, and apparently, volumetric effects. Expensive.
	*) 'Low'. Semi-transparent texture clearly usable for altitude estimation. Cheap, effective.
	*) Rendered under terrain. Always set MIN ('Low') in land-only environments (ie. Nevada) if possible.
*) Civ Traffic. 'Off' or 'Low'. May have performance impact on CPU/RAM and/or GPU/VRAM in some cases.
*) MSAA. Eliminates pixelation of nearby object edges even at >2.2TotalSR. May be expensive in some cases.
*) Visib Range. Keep 'Low' if possible.
*) Res of Cockpit Displays. May have a high performance impact, may or may not be limited to if mirrors are enabled.
