*) Gamma. Typically 2.0. . Shaders mod may require +0.2 adjustment .
*) Water. 'Low' for Nevada. 'Medium' or greater, if shaders mod enabled.
*) Grass/Trees. Reduce during startup if needed.

_Shader Mod_
*) Set "MASKSIZE" under "_HMD.hlsl" to 0.7 for Pimax 5kp at 'Normal' FOV.
*) Maybe disable 'SIMPLE_GRASS' under "_HMD.hlsl". May be unaesthetic.
*) Disable "shadows.hlsl". Use of shadows in VR is not recommended regardless.

*) Fixed Foveated Rendering apparently compiles some shaders in addition to those compiled without.

*) Water must be 'Medium' or greater. Removing the file for water from the mod did not resolve this.

	Testing has shown this setting has little or no impact, but may affect smart smoothing margins and quality. CPU frame latency margins may be impacted at >2. GPU frame latency margins may be impacted at <2.




_Quality_
-High Quality Tradeoffs-
A few features crucially impact readability, and should not be reduced unless necessary.
*) Textures.		Anything less than 'High'...
	*) May greatly reduce at least F5E instrument resolution.
	*) Greatly reduces FA18C AMPCD (moving map), kneeboard resolution. May reduce FA18C DDI resolution.
*) Terrain Textures	Only 'High'/'Low'.
	*) 'High' is needed to clearly recognize some roads and other markers from altitude.

A few features should not be enabled.
*) Shadows, Terrain Object Shadows. Extreme CPU frametime cost.
*) SSAA.

Some settings may be traded quickly to maintain framerates without serious loss of visual quality.
*) Water.
	*) 'High', 'Medium'. Add detailed surface wave, reflection, and apparently, volumetric effects. Expensive.
	*) 'Low'. Semi-transparent texture clearly usable for altitude estimation. Cheap, effective.
	*) Rendered under terrain. Always set MIN ('Low') in land-only environments (ie. Nevada) if possible.
*) Civ Traffic. 'Off' or 'Low'. May have performance impact on CPU/RAM and/or GPU/VRAM in some cases.
*) MSAA. Eliminates pixelation of nearby object edges even at >2.2TotalSR. May be expensive in some cases.
*) Visib Range. Keep 'Low' if possible.
*) Res of Cockpit Displays. May have a high performance impact, may or may not be limited to if mirrors are enabled.
