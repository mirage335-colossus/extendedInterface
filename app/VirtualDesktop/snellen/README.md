# Conclusion
## Pimax Vision 8kX
Unambigiously better than 20/32.
Approximately 20/20.
Total SR approximately 2.3x.

## Pimax 5k+
Unambigiously better than 20/50.
Approximately 20/40.



# Procedure
Using Snellen chart at https://wolfchart.org/ .

Configure for physical display.

Calculate display FOV at a distance and FOV that VirtualDesktop can match. Set to those parameters, recenter at that distance.

Compare both VR headset and desktop monitor feature sizes. Ensure VR headset view is no larger than display.

Roughly evaluate result (eg. 20/20).


# Example
65inch display at 10ft

1440mm display width
3048mm distance
206.375mm line width

50deg VirtualDesktop
1.50m Screen Distance
