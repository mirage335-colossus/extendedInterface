# Conclusion
## Pimax Vision 8kX
Unambigiously better than 20/32.
Approximately 20/20.
Total SR approximately 2.3x.


## Pimax 5k+
Unambigiously better than 20/50.
Approximately 20/40.


# Pitfalls
* Dim, standardized illumination may be used for eye exams, which is beyond the scope of this experiment.
* At 20/20, discerning a P from an F, was marginal, which as I understand it, is a sub-clinical finding.
* Blurring of the text was qualitatively very different from the kind of blurring expected from human vision defects. Small text tended to become subjectively more grey.
* Headset IPD, sweet spot alignment, etc, were a little more carefully managed than usually practical.
* Total SR was pushed rather high, >2x. Going beyond 1.5x was marginally different at most.
* VirtualDesktop was conservatively used with distance/FOV estimations. Due to problems with dedicated VR headset test apps.


# Procedure
Using Snellen chart at https://wolfchart.org/ .

Configure for physical display.

Calculate display FOV at a distance and FOV that VirtualDesktop can match. Set to those parameters, recenter at that distance.

Compare both VR headset and desktop monitor feature sizes. Ensure VR headset view is no larger than display.

Roughly evaluate result (eg. 20/20).


# Example
65inch display at 10ft

1440mm display width
3048mm distance
206.375mm line width

50deg VirtualDesktop
1.50m Screen Distance
