*) Inability to move or delete some system files (notably 'C:\Windows\System32\DisplaySwitch.exe' ) from command line scripts, regardless of ADMIN privileges.

*) Occasional high CPU usage from various services, updates, and changes - notably from recent updates to the Photos app.


*) Apparent inability to configure a file manager with expandable folders (ie. Dolphin file manager is not suffiently stable on MSW platform).
*) Apparent inability to create second taskbar on same desktop including all windows from all screens for management of 'fake' displays created by headless ghost devices.

*) Occasional permissions issues with Cygwin SSH daemon.
*) Occasional requirement for FileZilla (or comparable) instead of Dolphin file manager as SFTP client for Cygwin SSH daemon.


*) Apparent inability to configure mouse three button scroll not to pass through middle click. Use of official 'ThinkPad Compact Keyboard - Drivers' results in catastrophic CPU usage while running VR apps. By contrast, Xorg would handle this hardware independently, with negligible overhead.

*) Apparent relative lack of standardized graphics protocol. Notably, Xming compatibility issues were found with screen-scraping based programs like OVRDrop found while using TigerVNC clients.
